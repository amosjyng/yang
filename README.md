# yang é™½

Yang is a rudimentary, experimental code generator. It depends on [Yin](https://github.com/amosjyng/yin) to manage its internal state.

## Development

This crate is named `zamm_yang` for consistency with `zamm_yin`. However, the name for this tool is just `yang` for all intents and purposes within the ZAMM universe. I recommend building the binary accordingly:

    cargo run --bin yang
