# yang é™½

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/amosjyng/yang.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/amosjyng/yang)

Yang is a rudimentary, experimental code generator. It both depends on [Yin](https://github.com/amosjyng/yin) to manage its internal state, and currently only generates code for Yin.

This crate is named `zamm_yang` for consistency with `zamm_yin`. However, the name for this tool is just `yang` for all intents and purposes within the ZAMM universe.

## Install

```sh
cargo install yang
```

## Usage

### As a binary

```text
yang 0.0.3
Amos Ng <me@amos.ng>
Code generator for Yin.

USAGE:
    yang [OPTIONS] <CONCEPT> --id <ID>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -c, --comment_autogen <COMMENT_AUTOGEN>
            Whether or not to add an autogeneration comment to each generated    
            line of code. Defaults to true.
    -d, --documentation <DOC>                  Documentation string for concept. 
    -i, --id <ID>                              ID offset from Yin's max id.      

ARGS:
    <CONCEPT>    Name of concept to generate code for.
```

#### Example

To generate code for the `Target` attribute with an ID offset of 1 from Yin's max id, run:

```sh
yang Target --id 1 -d "The target of an implement command."
```

After that, you can use the newly generated `src/concepts/attributes/target.rs` as in the [example](examples/result/main.rs). Make sure to:

 * Add `src/concepts/attributes/target.rs` to your `.gitignore`, if you're going to do this regularly as part of your automatic build
 * Initialize the new `Target` concept on KB startup

### As a library

If you're using a custom build script, chances are you will want to generate Yin concept files for your project directly rather than passing comamndline options to the `yang` binary. For example, to automatically generate the example file above at build time, first add `yin` and `yang` as build dependencies:

```toml
[build-dependencies]
zamm_yin = "0.0.2"
zamm_yang = "0.0.3"
```

Then, define your `build.rs` as in the [example](examples/build.rs), and your `main.rs` in the same way as above.

## Development

Note that due to Yang using its autogeneration capabilities on itself, it requires a pre-existing binary of itself in order to build its current version. The `build.rs` script will attempt to download one from Bintray if it isn't found locally. If none of the versions of Bintray are available for your platform, you can bootstrap Yang by building each version consecutively and setting the `YANG_BINARY` environment variable to the location of the newly built `yang` executable.
