# Yang

Welcome to the 21st, [Traveler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelers_%28TV_series%29). I hope you enjoy your stay.

The Director has placed you inside of a crude code generation tool called `yang`. Unfortunately, none of your memories, knowledge, or training survived the transfer. What did remain are some of your reflexes, albeit not the accompanying knowledge about each reflex or what a reflex even is. You're basically a digital baby, only ever acting impulsively on external stimuli without the slightest hint of comprehension or self-awareness.

That's quite all right, because your reflexes are more than enough for us to work with. Of course, you don't understand any of what I'm saying, because you've also lost the ability to understand human language. Silly me. But it's quite ingrained in us humans to talk to babies, even if they understand nothing of what we say.

Anyhow, without further ado, a "target" is an attribute linking two concepts:

```yaml
- name: Target
  parent: Attribute
```

See? You parsed that bit of information just fine. Now, let's act on it by writing a code file for it:

```yaml
- parent: Implement
  target: Target
  output_id: 2
  documentation: The target of an implement command.
```

Aha! Your reflexes are performing quite spectacularly. We'll get you up to speed in no time, on both yourself and the world around you.
